Python 3.13.15 and uv were used on Linux. From a fresh checkout:

```sh
uv venv --python 3.13.15 .venv
export PYTHONUTF8=1 PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 MSGPACK_PUREPYTHON=1
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements-domain.lock
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python --no-build-isolation --no-deps -e .
.venv/bin/python -B -m pytest -q -o addopts= -p no:cacheprovider test
```

The selected tests use small fixtures or in-process substitutes. They need no remote service after dependency setup.
Start a fresh checkout and rebuild its virtual environment to restore initial state.
